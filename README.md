# Hi, I’m Mike 👋

I’m a computer engineer who builds practical web solutions and enjoys untangling technical problems that don’t come with instructions.

Most of my work lives at the intersection of **clean UI**, **real-world constraints**, and **shipping things that actually work**.

## 🛠 What I work with
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML, CSS, Tailwind
- Shopify (Liquid, custom sections)
- WordPress (themes, fixes, optimization)
- Git & GitHub
